# Pokedex - Original 151 Pokemon

This project is a Pokedex of the original 151 Pokemon, created with Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to browse through the first generation of Pokemon and view their details and stats.

## Credits

This project was inspired by the tutorial created by Ademir (Ade-mir) on building a Pokedex using PokeApi. Ademir's tutorial provided valuable insights into working with APIs and served as the foundation for this project. You can find the original tutorial repository [here](https://github.com/Ade-mir/pokedex-tutorial).

The design for this Pokedex was inspired by Ricardo Schiniegoski, who created the design on Figma. You can view the design [here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/979132880663340794/pokedex).
